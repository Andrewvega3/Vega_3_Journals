My tentative thoughts for my art project is that it will be challenge to try
but it will also be fun to try something diffrent.

What methods i might use is  will experiment with them and i will try to make
it look cool.

I will incorporate a for loop by coping the same format as the other project 
we did yesterday but will do other methods.

I will incorporate a if, else if, else by trying to put it in places that make
since.

What math i might use is try to make it fit the shapes where i want it and
use numbers to see where it goes.
