Im almost done with my methods. what i wanted to do is make a american flag 
and i typed a method for rectangles and stripes and stars for the flag. I 
noticed the art method code was shared in the journals and i just used it as a
refrence.
private void drawShapes(GraphicsContext gc) {
    gc.setFill(Color.RED);
    gc.fillRoundRect(110, 60, 30, 30, 10, 10);
