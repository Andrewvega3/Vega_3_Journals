How i'll use methods in my game is by using System.out.println("") and if, else loops because if the
user chooses to go somewhere then theyll go there but if not then else then 
theyll go a diffrent way or do something else. i'll use values such as static
void and answer = cesarneedsinfo.nextLine(); to pass the methods.
