i created a mazish game where you have to survive from multipe enemies 
attacking you and you can collect health potions to heal up.
challenges i solved was making the game work with my map.
when i got back i didnt even start on my map yet but i still finished it on 
time.
I wasnt able to meet the timeline because im still trying to make the enemys 
to have have lives and be able to attack you and for the player to attack the
enemy.
