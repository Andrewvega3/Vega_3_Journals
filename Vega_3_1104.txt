-A method is a procedure of systematic codes like we use in the Guessing Game 
project such as public static.
-Methods that I use in the Guessing Game is Scanners and else, if and while 
loops.
-A while loop is a code that is able to be repeated and its important to use 
in the guessing game because without it the program would just finish after 
one guess.
-I mostly used the while loop in the guessing game and i didnt use a boolean 
or a counter.
